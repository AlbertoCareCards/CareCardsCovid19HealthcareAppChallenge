[Covid19 Healthcare APP Challenge] CareCards - Cards Against Anxiety 
==============================================================================

This is the project repository submission of the CareCards team for the `Code for COVID Relief` hackathon
(more information in: https://healthcareappchallenge.devpost.com/).

The repository implements the `Cards Against Anxiety` game described in the project documentation. Integration of the
Healthcare Locator SDK has been achieved through a custom `Ember Addon` that makes integration of the `Javascript`
Healthcare SDK UI simple. This addon has been released as an `NPM` package to encourage the use of the SDK and is
also part of our submission for the event:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-hcl-sdk
